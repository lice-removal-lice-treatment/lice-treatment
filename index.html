        <h2>Historical Methods of Lice Treatment</h2>
        <p>In ancient times, the treatment of head lice involved various natural remedies. People used oils, vinegar, and even water to remove lice and nits from the scalp. These methods, while sometimes effective, were often cumbersome and not always safe for the skin.</p>
        <p>One popular historical lice treatment was the application of mayonnaise. The thick substance was believed to suffocate the lice, making it easier to remove them. However, this method had its limitations and was not always reliable.</p>

        <h2>Modern Lice Treatment Methods</h2>
        <p>Today, the treatment of head lice has become more sophisticated and effective. Over-the-counter medications, lice shampoos, and prescription medicines are now readily available. These products are designed to kill lice and nits while being safe for the scalp and skin.</p>
        <p>The FDA has approved several lice treatments that are both effective and safe. These include lotions and shampoos that contain active ingredients specifically targeting lice. Additionally, there are prescription medications available for more severe cases of lice infestation.</p>
        <p>Over-the-counter medicines for lice treatment are widely used due to their convenience and effectiveness. These products help control the spread of head lice, especially in school settings where the condition is highly contagious.</p>

        <h2>Prevention and Control of Head Lice</h2>
        <p>Prevention is a crucial aspect of lice treatment. Regular screening for head lice, especially in school-aged children, can help control the spread of pediculosis. Educating the public about the importance of maintaining personal hygiene and using effective lice treatments can significantly reduce the incidence of head lice.</p>
        <p>There are several no-nit policies in place in schools to prevent the spread of head lice. These policies require students to be free of nits before returning to school, ensuring a healthier environment for all children.</p>
